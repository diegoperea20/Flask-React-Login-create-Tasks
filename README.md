## Steps to implement it
Backend Options for do it: 

1. Use Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
2. Use virtual enviroments and apply  requirements.txt 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Use Docker 
```python
#Comands for use docker container mysql
docker run --name mymysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:latest

docker exec -it mymysql bash

#Inside of the container mysql
mysql -u root -p

create database flaskmysql;

```
Fronted React Options for do it:
1. Use Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
2. Download dependencies and libraries
```python
#Download dependencies
 npm install 

#you can use the useRoutes function of the wouter library. Next I will show you how to configure and use wouter in a React application with Vite:

npm install wouter 


#const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_REACT_APP_API;
npm install dotenv
```
